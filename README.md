## Custom Magisk

Custom Magisk by [TheHitMan7](https://github.com/TheHitMan7.git). Always synced with official changes including Magisk Hide, Hide the Magisk app, Magisk-Module-Repository features.
It will spoof/alter/manipulate non-Magisk related signals or traces to circumvent device state detection. Although included features are officially removed from Magisk.
I added them back while keeping the latest changes including Zygisk - Magisk in Zygote.
