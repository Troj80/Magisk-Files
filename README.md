## Custom Magisk

Custom Magisk by [TheHitMan7](https://github.com/TheHitMan7). Always synced with official changes including Magisk Hide, Hide the Magisk app, Magisk-Module-Repository features.
It will spoof/alter/manipulate non-Magisk related signals or traces to circumvent device state detection. Although included features are officially removed from Magisk.
I added them back while keeping the latest changes including Zygisk - Magisk in Zygote.

## Note

## Conflict

Do not use `app-release.apk` instead use `app-debug.apk`. Options like Hide the Magisk app, Magisk-Module-Repository, Check Safetynet does not work with stable APK release.
Latest version of App is also **N/A** with stable APK release. It looks like a check against official and unofficial Magisk release. Hence prevent certain features.

> **Completely uninstall previous Magisk before installing custom Magisk build. Even switching between custom Magisk builds also require full uninstall.**
